# Project Overview

## Goal and Context
The primary objective of this project was twofold: first, to implement a functional, simple software application (a Number Guessing Game); and second, to rigorously practice professional software development tools and workflows, specifically **Visual Studio Code**, **Git**, and **GitHub**.

## Technologies Used
| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python 3** | Used for rapid development of the core application logic (game loop, randomization). |
| **Visual Studio Code** | Served as the integrated development environment (IDE) for writing, testing, and debugging the code. |
| **Git** | The local version control system used to track changes, manage commits, and organize the project history. |
| **GitHub** | The remote hosting platform for the Git repository, enabling public sharing and facilitating potential collaboration. |
